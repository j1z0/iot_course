    ":Todo sorry this lesson is not complete just yet... need to flesh out some animations for it to make sense.... the idea is basically to animated the individual dots in the above animated gif in response to the user calling send_msg, or rec_msg above.  Then the \"mind scroll\" will actually know if they typed the correct code and let the use know they are doing it correctly or not."
